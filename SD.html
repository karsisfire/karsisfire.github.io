  <p class="xy">Best and value for money</>
  <p class="c">iPhone 11 and iPhone SE 2020 is most powerful and value for money smartphone at the price range of70k and 40k.</p>
  <p class="d">iPhone Xr is also a great choice for gaming, as games are more optimised for IOS. It can still give constant 60fps in pubg, fortnite, etc. being a 2 years old device.</p>
  <p class="c">If u are looking for the best Android Gaming device, Rog phone 3 is for u. At the price range of 50k no android phone can compete the performance of ROG 3, it doesn't end there Rog 3 has 4 Air triggers that can give an advantage for players that compete with other players. The display is even more interesting, 6'7 inch 144hz OLED panel with 270hz touch response which is powered by 6000mah battery.
  <p class="d">At the price range of 40k OnePlus 8 is a very good performing gaming device equipped with SD865, 90hz OLED panel with 180hz touch response.</p>
  <p class="c">If u don't have the budget to afford those gaming beast, realme x3 is the one u must consider, equipped with SD855+, UFS-3.0, 120hz LCD panel with 180hz touch response and 30 watt flash charger at the price range of only 25 to 30k</p>
  <p class="d">Dont buy OnePlus 8 pro, iqoo 3 and galaxy s20 seris for gaming although they are very good performer in gaming but still they are very fragile in terms of durability, iqoo 3 could also be a good option for gaming only if u play game in 60fps because it can't go beyond that.  </p>
